    "# Using Jamba 1.5 on Bedrock for Standard Operating Procedures and Regulatory Document Analysis\n",
    "In the pharmaceutical industry, regulatory compliance is crucial for ensuring the safety and efficacy of drug products. Regulatory bodies like the FDA establish detailed guidelines for drug manufacturing processes, which companies must align with through their Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Drug compliance officers play a key role in this by reviewing SOPs to identify and rectify any inconsistencies with regulatory standards. Automation tools, such as AI-based comparison systems, can streamline this process by efficiently analyzing and highlighting discrepancies between SOPs and regulatory documents, thereby enhancing compliance accuracy and ensuring the continuous quality of pharmaceutical products.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use AI21's Jamba 1.5 Large model analyze Subpart E Title 21 of the [Code of Fedral Regulations](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/collection/cfr/2023/title21/chapterI/subchapterC/part211), this section is nearly 30 pages long. We will use Jamba-1.5 Large to perform contradiction detection, to see if a mock Standard Operating Procedure is consistent with the the regulatory document."
